                <p>My name is Jaron and I am currently learning how to code. After 8+ years of working in sales professionally I have decided to make a career change. This is a website that I've built and below is a showcase of some small projects that I have created.</p>
               <p>Right now some of these sections might be empty, but they will continue to fill as I create more things during this bootcamp.</p>
